          Hello! I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated IT fresher with a strong passion for coding and software development. As a recent graduate with a specialization in Full Stack Python Development, I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, with a keen interest in building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

          Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Flask and Django for the back-end, as well as React and Angular for front-end development. I am well-versed in working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB and have an understanding of version control systems like Git.
          
          I am excited to contribute my skills to the development of innovative applications and look forward to the opportunity to grow in the field of full-stack development.</p>
